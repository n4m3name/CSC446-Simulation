    "CLASS QUEUES (M/M/1, G/G/1, M/M/c, etc.)\n",
    "- “Service” queues: jobs arrive → wait → get served → depart\n",
    "- Defined by A/B/c/N/K notation (arrival dist., service dist., servers, capacity)\n",
    "- FIFO or simple disciplines (FIFO, LIFO, priority, random)\n",
    "- Key parameters: λ (arrival rate), μ (service rate), ρ (utilization)\n",
    "- Require a server with a service time distribution\n",
    "- Usually one queue line (or c identical parallel servers)\n",
    "- Goals: compute W, Wq, L, Lq, stability (ρ < 1)\n",
    "- No notion of price; all jobs are homogeneous\n",
    "\n",
    "STOCK MARKET QUEUES (Bid/Ask LOB)\n",
    "- Not service queues; orders do not receive “service” but wait for matching or cancellation\n",
    "- Two sides: Bid (max-price priority) and Ask (min-price priority)\n",
    "- One FIFO queue per price level; many queues in parallel\n",
    "- Matching happens when buy price ≥ sell price; no service rate μ\n",
    "- Strict priority: price priority first, FIFO within the same price level\n",
    "- Orders may be partially filled, canceled, or modified at any time\n",
    "- Market orders bypass queues and execute immediately\n",
    "- System is event-driven, not service-time-driven\n",
    "- Heterogeneous orders: limit, market, cancel, modify, each with price and quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY DIFFERENCES\n",
    "- Class queues are time-driven service models; LOB is an event-driven matching system\n",
    "- Class queues use service rates μ; LOB has no service times or servers\n",
    "- Class queues have one main queue; LOB has many price-level queues with priority\n",
    "- Class queues use FIFO; LOB uses price priority → FIFO\n",
    "- Class queues rely on steady-state formulas; LOB follows matching rules\n"
