    "- FIFO or simple disciplines (FIFO, LIFO, priority, random)\n",
    "- Key parameters: λ (arrival rate), μ (service rate), ρ (utilization)\n",
    "- Require a server with a service time distribution\n",
    "- Usually one queue line (or c identical parallel servers)\n",
    "- Goals: compute W, Wq, L, Lq, stability (ρ < 1)\n",

    "STOCK MARKET QUEUES (Bid/Ask LOB)\n",
    "- Not service queues; orders do not receive “service” but wait for matching or cancellation\n",
    "- Two sides: Bid (max-price priority) and Ask (min-price priority)\n",
    "- One FIFO queue per price level; many queues in parallel\n",
    "- Matching happens when buy price ≥ sell price; no service rate μ\n",

    "- Class queues are time-driven service models; LOB is an event-driven matching system\n",
    "- Class queues use service rates μ; LOB has no service times or servers\n",
    "- Class queues have one main queue; LOB has many price-level queues with priority\n",
    "- Class queues use FIFO; LOB uses price priority → FIFO\n",
