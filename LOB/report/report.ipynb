    "### A. Order Flow Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "(Governed by: $\\lambda_{limit\\_buy}$, $\\lambda_{limit\\_sell}$, $\\lambda_{mkt\\_buy}$, $\\lambda_{mkt\\_sell}$, $\\lambda_{cancel}$, `order_size_mean`)\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables define the market environment created by the \"noise\" traders. The metrics measure the resulting stability and depth of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Focus Area | Metric to Record | Rationale |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Liquidity** | **Average Bid-Ask Spread** | Measures the *transaction cost* of immediacy. Higher order arrival rates ($\\lambda_{limit}$) should decrease this, while higher consumption rates ($\\lambda_{mkt}$) might increase it. |\n",
    "| **Liquidity** | **LOB Depth** (e.g., Average Volume within $\\pm 5$ ticks) | Measures the amount of standing limit orders, which is directly related to $\\lambda_{limit}$ and `order_size_mean`. Deep liquidity buffers the price against large market orders. |\n",
    "| **Liquidity** | **Resting Execution Times** (Mean, Median, P99) | Measures the time it takes for a limit order to be filled. High $\\lambda_{mkt}$ decreases this; high $\\lambda_{limit}$ increases it. |\n",
    "| **Volatility/Price Discovery** | **Trade Count / Trades Per Hour** | Measures the activity level and throughput of the market. Directly reflects the combined effect of $\\lambda_{mkt}$ rates. |\n",
    "| **Volatility/Price Discovery** | **Price Volatility** (e.g., Variance of Mid-Price Returns) | Measures the stability of the price process. High $\\lambda_{mkt}$ and low LOB depth can lead to higher volatility. |\n",
    "| **Trader Behavior** | **Resting vs. Market Execution Ratio** | Measures the ratio of liquidity supplied (resting limit orders) versus liquidity demanded (market orders). Affected by the balance of $\\lambda_{limit}$ and $\\lambda_{mkt}$. |\n",

    "| Focus Area | Metric to Record | Rationale |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Liquidity** | **LOB Depth at specific levels** (e.g., $1^{\\text{st}}$, $2^{\\text{nd}}$, $3^{\\text{rd}}$ tick)  | **Crucial** for `limit_price_decay_rate`. This measures *where* the liquidity resides. A low decay rate will result in a flatter depth profile, while a high decay rate will show a large volume at the Best Bid/Ask and then a sharp drop-off. |\n",
    "| **Liquidity** | **Tick-to-Tick Spread** | Measures how often the spread is exactly one tick. A well-functioning LOB with a high decay rate should have a tight, often one-tick, spread. |\n",
    "| **Efficiency** | **Price Movement per Unit Volume** (Effective Spread) | Measures market impact: how much the price moves for a given trade size. This is inversely related to overall depth (which is heavily influenced by `limit_price_decay_rate`). |\n",
    "| **Efficiency** | **Simulation Run Time** (for comparison/scaling) | While not a financial metric, recording the computation time relative to `sim_duration` is useful for assessing simulation efficiency and scaling. |\n",

    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **MM Profitability** | **MM Final PnL** (Total, Per Hour, Per Trade) | The ultimate measure of the strategy's success. Higher `mm_base_spread` generally leads to higher PnL, but higher `mm_skew_coef` may reduce PnL if it pushes quotes too far from the best price. |\n",
    "| **MM Risk Management** | **MM Final/Average Inventory** \n",
    "\n",
    "[Image of Market Maker Inventory Over Time]\n",
    " | Measures how effectively the MM controls their risk exposure. A good strategy (e.g., effective `mm_skew_coef`) should keep the average inventory close to zero. |\n",
    "| **MM Risk Management** | **MM Realized Spread** | Measures the profit the MM actually makes per round trip, calculated as the difference between the mid-price at execution and the quoted price. This reveals adverse selection risk. |\n",
    "| **Liquidity Impact** | **MM Contribution to Depth** | Measures the percentage of volume at the Best Bid/Ask that is placed by the Market Maker. Directly affected by all three MM parameters. |"
