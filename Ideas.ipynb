    "Excellent ‚Äî given your uploaded **course guidelines**and your current **Limit Order Book (LOB)** proposal, your project is already a solid Option A simulation study. But since both of you have a strong **math + CS + finance** background, there‚Äôs a lot of room to make it both more **innovative** and **research-relevant** while still remaining within the course‚Äôs scope (discrete-event simulation, replication, analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are **five enhancement directions** ‚Äî all feasible within the structure of your outline but each touching a **current research frontier** in market microstructure and stochastic simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Adaptive / Learning Market Makers (Multi-Agent Extension)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:** Replace fixed quoting strategies with agents that adapt their quotes using reinforcement learning (RL) or dynamic programming heuristics.\n",
    "Each market maker could learn a policy $\\pi(a|s)$ that adjusts spreads and inventory targets in response to state variables (volatility, queue imbalance, inventory).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it‚Äôs interesting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connects LOB simulation to **algorithmic trading and market microstructure AI**.\n",
    "* Shows how local adaptive behavior affects global liquidity and volatility.\n",
    "* You could test convergence, stability, and profitability versus static strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feasibility:**\n",
    "The simulation remains a discrete-event system ‚Äî only order-placement rules change. You can use simple $\\epsilon$-greedy or tabular Q-learning with discrete state bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Heavy-Tail and Self-Exciting Order Arrivals (Look into jump diffusion)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:** Replace simple Poisson arrivals with **Hawkes processes** or **Pareto-tailed inter-arrival times** to model clustering of activity (‚Äúbursty‚Äù markets).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it‚Äôs interesting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real markets show self-exciting behavior ‚Äî volatility clustering, order flow autocorrelation.\n",
    "* Simulating a Hawkes process $N_t$ with intensity $\\lambda_t = \\mu + \\alpha \\sum_{t_i < t} e^{-\\beta (t-t_i)}$ introduces realistic dynamics.\n",
    "* Lets you study how liquidity risk changes under clustered vs. memoryless arrivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feasibility:**\n",
    "SimPy can easily generate arrivals from a Hawkes or renewal process; the queueing and execution logic remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Latency, Information Asymmetry, and Flash-Crash Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:** Introduce **latency differentials** among traders and simulate how small timing advantages destabilize prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it‚Äôs interesting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Links to current research on **latency arbitrage**, market stability, and flash-crash propagation.\n",
    "* You can experiment with how microsecond delays alter execution fairness or volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feasibility:**\n",
    "Add a per-agent delay parameter before order submission; track price oscillations and liquidity drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Market Impact and Price Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:** Add a simple **price-impact model** where large market orders shift the mid-price according to an impact function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta P = \\eta \\cdot \\text{sign}(q) |q|^\\gamma\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $\\eta,\\gamma$ empirical constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it‚Äôs interesting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lets you study feedback between order flow and price evolution.\n",
    "* Bridges simulation with econometric measures like Kyle‚Äôs $\\lambda$ or Amihud‚Äôs illiquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feasibility:**\n",
    "Mid-price updates after each execution; still event-driven and replicable within the same simulation skeleton.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Information-Driven vs. Liquidity-Driven Traders\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:** Split agents into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Informed traders** whose orders correlate with a latent ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù value process.\n",
    "* **Noise traders** who place random orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it‚Äôs interesting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Captures **price discovery** mechanisms and tests market efficiency.\n",
    "* Can show how informed participation affects spreads and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feasibility:**\n",
    "Simulate a latent Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck price process; informed traders trade based on expected value, others randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Recommended Combinations (Balanced Scope)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want **one strong, publishable-level direction** without overreaching for a course project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combine (2) **Hawkes arrivals** + (3) **latency differentials** for ‚ÄúSimulating Market Instability under Self-Exciting Order Flow‚Äù.\n",
    "* Or combine (1) **adaptive market makers** + (4) **price impact** for ‚ÄúLearning-Based Market Making under Feedback-Coupled Price Dynamics‚Äù.\n",
