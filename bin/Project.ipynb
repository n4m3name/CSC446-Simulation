    "# Project Proposal: Simulating a Limit Order Book (LOB) and Market Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to simulate the dynamics of a financial market’s limit order book (LOB), such as those used in the TSX or NASDAQ, using discrete-event simulation.  \n",
    "The study will model random arrivals of buy and sell orders, cancellations, and executions, and evaluate the performance of different market-making strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key goals include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding how stochastic order arrivals influence market liquidity and price dynamics.  \n",
    "- Measuring execution speed, bid-ask spreads, and volatility.  \n",
    "- Exploring trade-offs between market maker profit, inventory risk, and system efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The system represents an electronic market where traders submit limit and market orders for a single asset.  \n",
    "Each order is modeled as an event in the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limit orders:** Orders to buy or sell at a specified price; join a price-level queue if not immediately executable.  \n",
    "- **Market orders:** Orders executed immediately at the best available price.  \n",
    "- **Cancellations:** Limit orders may leave the queue before execution (modeled as reneging).  \n",
    "- **Executions:** Orders matched according to price–time priority, removing them from the order book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order book is modeled as a set of queues, one for each discrete price level.  \n",
    "Market makers act as servers who post buy/sell orders at different prices.  \n",
    "If a counter-order exists, execution occurs; otherwise, the order waits in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key system states include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Best bid, best ask, and mid-price  \n",
    "- Queue depth at each price level  \n",
    "- Market maker inventory and profit  \n",
    "\n",
    "The system allows experimentation with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of market makers (servers)  \n",
    "- Quoting strategies (tight vs. wide spreads, dynamic quotes)  \n",
    "- Arrival rates to simulate volatile periods  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Example Setting | Rationale |\n",
    "|------------|----------------|------------|\n",
    "| Buy limit order arrival rate | $\\lambda_{\\text{buy\\_limit}} = 10$ orders/min | Poisson arrivals capture stochastic behavior |\n",
    "| Sell limit order arrival rate | $\\lambda_{\\text{sell\\_limit}} = 10$ orders/min | Symmetric market assumption |\n",
    "| Market order arrival rate | $\\lambda_{\\text{market}} = 5$ orders/min | Market orders execute immediately |\n",
    "| Cancellation rate | $\\mu_{\\text{cancel}} = 0.1$/min | Represents reneging or order expiration |\n",
    "| Order size | $\\mathrm{Poisson}(1\\text{–}5)$ shares | Introduces variability in queue length |\n",
    "| Number of market makers | 1–3 | Server capacity impacts execution speed |\n",
    "| Quote placement offset | $\\pm k$ ticks from mid-price | Controls liquidity provision and risk exposure |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation will be implemented as a **discrete-event system** in Python using `SimPy`, with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**  \n",
    "   Empty order book, market maker positions, and simulation clock.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Event generation:**  \n",
    "   Random arrivals of buy/sell limit and market orders, plus cancellations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event handling:**  \n",
    "   - Market orders execute immediately if matching orders exist.  \n",
    "   - Limit orders join the appropriate price-level queue.  \n",
    "   - Cancellations remove orders from queues (reneging).  \n",
    "   - Market makers act as servers, posting quotes and executing trades.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data collection:**  \n",
    "   For each replication, track:\n",
    "   - Execution time and waiting time distributions  \n",
    "   - Bid-ask spread and mid-price volatility  \n",
    "   - Fill ratio of orders  \n",
    "   - Market maker P\\&L and inventory levels  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Replication:**  \n",
    "   Perform multiple runs with at least five different random seeds to estimate statistics with 95% confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For each scenario (e.g., number of market makers, quoting strategy, arrival rate):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute average and tail metrics across replications.  \n",
    "- Compare performance of different market-making strategies.  \n",
    "- Evaluate trade-offs between execution speed, liquidity, volatility, and profit.  \n",
    "- Examine scenarios under high-order-volume periods to stress-test the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will quantitatively evaluate how stochastic order flow and market-making policies affect market performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key expected insights include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faster execution and tighter spreads with more active market makers.  \n",
    "- Trade-offs between market maker profit and risk exposure.  \n",
    "- The impact of arrival rates and cancellations on order execution and liquidity.  \n",
    "- Demonstration of discrete-event simulation as a powerful tool for analyzing financial market microstructure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Optional recommendations may include:\n",
    "- Optimal server (market maker) allocation,  \n",
    "- Dynamic quoting rules, or  \n",
    "- Priority adjustments to improve execution speed without significantly increasing risk or volatility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Extensions and Research Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "If time permits beyond the baseline implementation, we plan to incorporate additional research-oriented extensions to enhance realism and analytical depth:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adaptive or learning market makers** that adjust spreads dynamically using reinforcement learning or rule-based policies.  \n",
    "2. **Heavy-tailed or self-exciting (Hawkes) order arrivals** to capture volatility clustering and bursty trading behavior.  \n",
    "3. **Latency and information asymmetry effects** to study fairness and instability under heterogeneous agent delays.  \n",
    "4. **Price impact modeling**, where large trades influence the mid-price through nonlinear feedback functions.  \n",
    "5. **Informed versus noise trader dynamics**, linking execution to a latent “fundamental” price process.  \n",
    "6. **Endogenous price formation**, where prices evolve directly from agent interactions and order-book states rather than from an exogenous price process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal for this course project will be to develop a **simplistic, working limit order book simulation** with correct queueing dynamics, validated through replication and statistical analysis.  \n",
    "These extensions represent **potential research enhancements** that we will implement and analyze if time allows.\n"
